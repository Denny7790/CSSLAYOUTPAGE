    <p style="color: blue; font-size:200%; clear: left;"> Practicing HTML is fun. <em>so far </em> we have 
        that help us describe how we want our webpages to look. we have tried the head,
        title, h (heanding) and paragraph tags so far. very few people know all the tags in
        HTML, but that is okay because we can do a lot with just some basic tags. we can 
        learn about new tags when we need them.</p>
